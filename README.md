Like we said we would bootstrapped the project with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

### To run the project locally

By default Next.js uses yarn as package manager:

First install the dependencies and run the development server:

Make to add the keys in your `.env` file

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Important.

Running `yarn build` will give you the opportunity to see if the website will build properly in deployment. Always make sure it completes with no error before doing a `pull request`.

Do not forget to create a new branch each time to avoid pushing directly into the master branch.

## Notes

See the setup [Trello Card for more info](https://trello.com/c/64CU6m6L/32-set-up-nextjs-initial-project)

## Node version

The recommended node version is `12.18.4`, so we can stay in sync with AWS supported version.
